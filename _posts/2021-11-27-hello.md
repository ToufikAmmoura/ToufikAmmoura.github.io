A large list of instructions, a stack, finite memory, and a handfull of 32- 16- and 8-bit register. Components that make running programs possible but are used in various ways throughout the different levels of language. Registers do not even come up in the mind when coding a Python script since the interpreter is going to worry about that, but making a step in Assembly without one is essentially impossible. Needless to say this was the whole point behind designing new languages because programmers could not be bothered to think about all the different details going on in the background. 

Yet, this was exactly what I wanted to experience. In order to appreciate what these high level languages were offering us I had to see for myself what has been removed from the shoulders of us, the programmers. So I had to dive deep in the ancient scriptures and try to understand how every 1 and 0 traversed through the computer.

.text
main:
    mov     eax, 10
    add     eax, 20
    push    eax
